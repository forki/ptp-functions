These scripts gather data about the progress of legislation in the Indiana General Assembly via its [API](http://docs.api.iga.in.gov/api.html). This can help politically-active organizations track the progress of bills that are important to them.

## Building

These scripts are written with [F#](http://fsharp.org/), a cross-platform functional language built on the .Net framework. You can find instructions for installing F# on your system at [fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org/).

## Configuration

The scripts assume the presence of the following environment variables:

* `IgaApiKey`: an API key for the Indiana General Assembly API.
* `SessionYear`: the current IGA session year (i.e. _2017_)
* `WindowsAzure.StorageAccount`: a connection string to a Microsoft Azure storage account. This will store email attachments generated by the service.
* `SqlServer.ConnectionString`: a connection string for a SQL server instance. See the [Database](#database) section for instructions on creating this database.
* `ServiceBus.ConnectionString`: a connection string for an Azure Service Bus namespace with Send+Listen permissions. See the [Service Bus Queues](#service-bus-queues) section for instructions on setting up the Service Bus queues.
* `SendGridApiKey`: an API key for SendGrid with permission to send email.
* `Twilio.AccountSid`: A Twilio account identifer (for SMS delivery)
* `Twilio.AuthToken`: A Twilio API auth token (for SMS delivery)
* `Twilio.PhoneNumber`: A Twilio phone number (for SMS delivery)

## Deployment

### Functions

The scripts are intended to be run as [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/). After creating your Function App and cloning this repository, you can connect the Function App to your GitHub repo. It will automatically detect changes and deploy the functions.

### Database

Run the [createDbTables.sql](scaffolding/createDbTables.sql) script to generate the database tables targeted by the functions. The `SqlServer.ConnectionString` should reference this database with read/write permissions.

### Service Bus Queues

The following Azure Service Bus Queues should be created with default settings (1 GB, partitioned):  

* alert
* schedule
* digest
* notification
